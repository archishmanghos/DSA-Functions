- Post-Order traversal specifies traversing [left Node -> right Node -> root]. <br>
- We start traversal for the root, recursively move towards the left child, if there are no left child, proceed for the right child of the root, if there are no right child, print the current root. <br>
- The root prints only after the left and right child have been printed or they do not exist. <br>
